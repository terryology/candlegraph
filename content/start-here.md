## What is Candlegraph?

Candlegraph is a data-driven candle review site. Instead of just describing scents, I measure actual performance—burn time, cost efficiency, and throw potency—to calculate objective value indexes (SAV and PAE) for each brand.

Think of it as "candle reviews meet data science."

## First Time Visitors

**Start with these three posts:**

1. **[Welcome to Candlegraph](/post/welcome/)** - Quick intro to what this site is about (2 min read)

2. **[How Candlegraph Started](/post/origin-story/)** - The journey from Excel hobby to systematic performance analysis (8 min read)

## Looking for Reviews?

**Published Reviews:**
- [Diptyque Narguile](/post/diptyque-narguile-review/) - Luxury tobacco and honey candle
- [View all reviews](/tags/reviews/) - Complete archive

**Understanding the Metrics:**
- **SAV Index** - Scent Adjusted Value (throw potency relative to collection average)
- **PAE Index** - Price-Adjusted Efficiency (burn hours per dollar relative to collection average)
- **100 = Collection Average** - Higher is better, lower is worse

Check the [methodology page](/methodology/) for the full formulas.

## What's Next?

I'm actively burning candles and building the dataset. Expect new reviews every few weeks as candles finish burning and data is collected.

**Currently measuring:**
- [Brands will be listed as you add them]

**Coming soon:**
- Interactive Tableau performance map
- More luxury brand reviews
- Deep dive on the "hot throw measurement problem"

## Questions?

- **"Why these specific brands?"** - Mix of what I've purchased (supporting local/small businesses) and what I'm curious about testing
- **"How long does it take to review a candle?"** - 30-50 hours of burn time spread across multiple sessions, plus data analysis
- **"Can I request a brand?"** - Not currently taking requests, but I'm always open to suggestions!
